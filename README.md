Combining BERT with WordNet sense embeddings to predict graded word similarity changes

This system is described in the paper UZH at SemEval-2020 Task 3: Combining BERT with WordNet sense embeddings to predict 
graded word similarity changes" (July 2020, submitted), by Li Tang (University of Zurich, Switzerland).

Some of the code is derived from the baseline algorithm provided for SemEval 2020, task 3
See Carlos Santos Armendariz, Matthew Purver, Matej Ulcar et al. 2019. CoSimLex: 
   A Resource for Evaluating Graded Word Similarity in Context arXiv:1912.05320v2

Refquired input files, in the same directory as this Python code.
- refresults.txt: output generated by the baseline algorithm
- cosimlex_en.csv: gold labels
- lmms_1024.bert-large-cased.txt: pre-calculated average vectors for word senses, from Loureiro et al. (2019)

Start the script with Python 3.7.6 using 'python corrmodel.v2.py" on the terminal.
