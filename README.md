Combining BERT with WordNet sense embeddings to predict graded word similarity changes

This system is described in the paper "UZH at SemEval-2020 Task 3: Combining BERT with WordNet sense embeddings to predict 
graded word similarity changes" (July 2020, submitted), by Li Tang (University of Zurich, Switzerland).

SemEval 2020, task 3: https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20905

Some of the code is derived from the baseline algorithm provided for SemEval 2020, task 3.

   A Resource for Evaluating Graded Word Similarity in Context", arXiv:1912.05320v2

Refquired input files, in the same directory as this Python code.
- refresults.txt: output generated by the baseline algorithm
- cosimlex_en.csv: gold labels
- lmms_1024.bert-large-cased.txt: pre-calculated average vectors for word senses, from Loureiro et al. (2019)

The word sense vectors (lmms_1024.bert-large-cased.txt) can be obtained from: https://github.com/danlou/lmms#download-sense-embeddings

Start the script with Python 3.7.6 using 'python corrmodel.v2.py" on the terminal. To understand the algorithm, you can uncomment additional print commands in the code.
